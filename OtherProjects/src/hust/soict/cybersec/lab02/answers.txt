Q: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
A: In Java, it is possible to define multiple constructor methods for a class, each with a different parameter list. This is known as constructor overloading, which allows a class to be initialized with different combinations of parameters.
